## --@STCGoal The FTS methodology combines fractal geometry, technical indicators, and AI to identify profitable trading opportunities by analyzing five dimensions: Fractal, Momentum, Acceleration/Deceleration, Zone, and Balance Lines.

**Goal:** To develop a comprehensive understanding of the FTS methodology and provide guidance on the necessary steps to prepare data for bot and recognition learning using an appropriate model.

**Objectives:**

1. **Understand the FTS Methodology:**
   - Review the five dimensions of the FTS methodology: Fractal, Momentum, Acceleration/Deceleration, Zone, and Balance Lines.
   - Comprehend the principles and concepts behind each dimension.

2. **Data Preparation for Bot and Recognition Learning:**
   - Identify the relevant features to extract from market data for each dimension.
   - Apply appropriate feature engineering techniques to enhance data quality and predictive power.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Explore different machine learning models suitable for the FTS methodology.
   - Train and evaluate models using the prepared data, optimizing parameters for best performance.

4. **Deployment and Evaluation:**
   - Deploy the trained model in a bot or recognition system for real-time market analysis.
   - Monitor and evaluate the performance of the system, making adjustments as needed.

**Expected Outcomes:**

- A thorough understanding of the FTS methodology and its application in trading.
- A well-prepared dataset for bot and recognition learning.
- A trained and optimized model that effectively captures the dynamics of the FTS methodology.
- A deployed system that leverages the FTS methodology for profitable trading opportunities.
